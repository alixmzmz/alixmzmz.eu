			<h1>ALOHA!</h1>
<h2>WHAT'S GOING ON?</h2>
<br/><p>My name is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/alix-mart%C3%ADnez/19/37b/600" target="_blank">Alix Martínez</a>, last week I was reading an article on the internet and find out a link to your studio. I really liked what I saw, and realised that you are looking for a Senior Designer, so I decided to apply for the role.</p>
<br/><p>I am currently working at <a href="http://www.fjordnet.com/" target="_blank">Fjord</a>. Since I started working here last May I was involved in a couple of projects. One of those was a well-known bank in Africa. We designed various services to change the way this client interacts with its customers. Lately we have been creating a tablet and mobile app (Android and iOS).</p>
<br/><p>Originally from A Coruña (Spain) I have been based in various Spanish cities, as well as other European countries such as Germany, Italy and Ireland.</p>
<br/><p>Prior to Fjord I delivered creative solutions for different brands such as Bwin.party Digital Entertainment. I was also part of the UX Team at Riplife Gaming Technologies delivering software services to Bodog Group brands. In Barcelona I developed my career at Aedgency as Visual Designer on the Marketing department and worked as the Deenero Lead Visual Designer (a cashback product).</p>
<br/><p>Previous experience helped develop my visual style whilst being Interactive producer at Gravitate in Dublin, Graphic Designer in various studios including Agrafojo+Asocs, D!mpresion in A Coruña, Visual Designer at Undergraphic an Advertising agency at sunny Cagliari (Italy) and Lead Illustrator in a regional brunch for the Spanish national publishing company Rodeira-Edebe.</p>
<br/><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jSp2xmmEE" target="_blank"> Right here, right now</a> my portfolio is not updated with the latest projects I've been working on. So, would be nice to meet you, grab a coffee and go through them with you. Also I am open to develop a concept based on a brief you provide. How does it sounds?</p>
<br/><p>I am looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<br/><p>Best, </p>
