			<h1>DEAR GOLDSMITHS,</h1>
<p>I am a person who tends to think that questions are more important than answers. One of the earliest memories I have is of me asking two friends about what the meaning of life was and why we were here. This strikes me now, as I never heard them being asked by an adult before.</p>
<p>As a child my parents enrolled me in an after-school activity: crafts and painting. I didn’t realise it then but this is where my love for art began. I loved to go to museums with my father. Reading and studying are two of my life’s pleasures, inspired by the thousands of books in every corner of my parents’ home.</p>
<p>Maths was never my thing so I switched from Architecture to Fine Arts and studied at the University of <a href="http://bbaa.usal.es/" target="_blank">Salamanca</a>; founded in 1134, it is the third oldest university in the world. I was able to attend university with grants and by working while studying: while my parents are not rich they decided that my education would be their heritage. These are the values I grew up with, and how fortunate I am for it!</p>
<p>Before finishing my Bachelor degree in Fine Arts I spent 2001, my final year, in <a href="https://www.th-nuernberg.de/" target="_blank">Nuremberg on an Erasmus grant</a>. I discovered what technology was at the incredible installations in Germany.</p>
<p>I started working as a designer after graduation and moved to Milan in 2003 to get a <a href="http://www.scuoladesign.com/" target="_blank">Master’s Degree in Web Design from the Scuola Politecnica</a>. These studies were sponsored by a bank from the region in Spain where I came from: Galicia. One of my final projects was a reflection on the freedom of creativity and originality in net art.</p>
<p>Over the last 15 years I have evolved from Print, Graphic, Web, Visual, and UX/UI design to my current work as a Service Designer. Yet despite the fact that my job has always focused on design, art is my true love.</p>
<p>I visit a range of exhibitions every year, with landmark events including seeing Ryoji Ikeda perform in a baroque church and attending the opening of the Science Museum and its inaugural exhibition on light in Dublin in 2003. I also attended the Sonar and <a href="http://www.cccb.org/en/exhibitions/file/big-bang-data/45167" target="_blank">Big Bang Data</a> shows in Barcelona in 2014, visited the <a href="http://www.mona.net.au/" target="_blank">MONA Museum in Tasmania</a>, saw the Digital Revolution at Barbican and the Electronic Superhighway at the Whitechapel Gallery in London. Discovering The Creators Project blog has also had enormous impact. The digital art seed grew bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>As usual, I attended a number of talks and courses last year, including <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/courses-and-workshops/creative-act" target="_blank">The Creative Act at the Tate Modern</a> and <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/courses-and-workshops/art-age-digital-drift" target="_blank">The Art in the Digital Drift at the Tate Britain</a>. In both I tried to answer some of my long list of questions: What is digital art? Is digital art mature? How should digital material be archived? Does art follow technology? How do we interact with systems? Is technology the material of digital art? Where are the barriers between design and digital art? When will we merge with machines? Has contemporary art become mainstream, as Grayson Perry argues? I could go on and on...</p>
<p>I currently work as a Visual Design Lead at <a href="https://www.fjordnet.com/" target="_blank">Fjord</a>, part of Accenture Innovation. Fjord helps to introduce digital throughout organisations by bringing digital services to life. I want to incorporate digital art more in my daily work.  As a designer I am interested in emotions, interactions, behaviours, and how we adapt and evolve.</p>
<p>I have spent years observing, reflecting on, and studying art in my spare time and now is the time to start building my own practice. But how, when I lack the technical skills to develop my ideas?</p>
<p>A MA in Computational Arts at Goldsmiths is the perfect match. I attended the open day and loved everything the programme has to offer, from its approach to the subject to the samples of work from last year’s students. I have already arranged my schedule with Fjord so that I can work less hours next year while studying for the MA and working at the same time.</p>
<p>While I know it won’t be easy, the knowledge I will be to acquire with the MA will help me to connect design and creative technology in the studio as well as enhance the creative technical knowledge I contribute to projects.</p>
<p>I expect to find a great network of colleagues, individuals that will share my love for art and multimedia. Colleagues and mentors that will stand by my side and help me develop my practice. I believe Goldsmiths is the perfect place to find the right answers to my questions. As Schopenhauer said, “Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world”. I want to expand these limits and show everyone my view of the world.<p>
<p>I do not have a clear agenda yet. I love light and colour and I am interested in social disadvantages as well as in mental diseases. Kickboxing has shown me how to focus and to never stop giving my all, to be brave in the face of the unknown. And here I am. I believe that art is the search for truth, and that everyone has their own. I know that one day I will switch from design to art. I hope that this moment is just around the corner.</p>
